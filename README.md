# ZigZag-Challenge

Have the function **Zigzag(string [] strArr)** read the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain two elements, the first some sort of string and the second element will be a number ranging from 1 to 6. The number represents how many rows to print the string on so that it forms a zig-zag pattern.

_For example:_ if **strArr** is ["coderbyte", "3"] then this word will look like the following if you print it in a zig-zag pattern with 3 rows:

Your program should return the word formed by combining the characters as you iterate through each row, so for this example your program should return the string **creoebtdy**.


### Examples

```
Input: new string[] {"cat", "5"}

Output: cat


Input: new string[] {"kaamvjjfl", "4"}

Output: kjajfavlm
```
